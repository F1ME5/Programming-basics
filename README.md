# Programming-basics
C++ program where I practiced the most basic programming topics (OOP not included).

If you wanna take a look of functions, arrays, matrixs, loops or another basic topic you need to study, here's a c++ program that build a square matrix (size given by you) of asterisks (char).
There's a char (O) that you can move on the matrix. Movement options are printed in console ;). Also you'll have the exit option, so don't worry if the loop looks infinite!

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
